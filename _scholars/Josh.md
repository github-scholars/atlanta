My name is Joshua Marshall, class of 2018, and I attend Henry County High School, located in McDonough, GA. I'm an all A honor roll student along with the fact that my class rank is number 10 out of 253 people in my class. I currently study engineering and computer programming. In the summer of 2017, I received a scholarship to a Black and College Bound summer program, specifically for students interested in technology. Additionally, I play basketball, volunteer very often and play music. I play the flute, piano, and guitar and I love technology.
