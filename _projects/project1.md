<p>Tutor Gang is an organization created by blacks for blacks. Tutor Gang is a tutoring program that is dedicated to teaching young black middle schoolers the fundamentals of mathematics, writing and reading. We are based in Atlanta, Georgia and we plan to target only about 15 middle schoolers. We want to teach young blacks the academic fundamentals so that when they begin their journey into high school, they feel more comfortable with the material and they will feel more inclined to take more rigorous courses, thus giving them a drive to ensure a better future for themselves. </p>
