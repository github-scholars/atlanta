<p> We are currently working on JoyApp, a mobile application project to solve a social issue in the community to help people with depression. Depression and other similar mental illnesses are a major problem in communities which can eventually lead to suicide, which is an even more collosal problem. To solve this problem, we will develop 'JoyApp' which helps calm the mind of depressed students and relieve them of stress by having licensed psychologists video-chat in and talk about pressing issues with the user. Our app would have a very personalized approach, and would prompt questions to ask exactly what the problem is that's ailing the user. This project can and will be measured by the suicide rate to see and determine whether it actually relieves them.  </p>
