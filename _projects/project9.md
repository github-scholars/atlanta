<p> We are currently working on a project to solve a social issue either localy or in the community to help people with depression. Depression is a major problem in communities which can lead to suicide, which is a collosal problem. To solve this problem, we will have an app which helps calm the mind of depressed students and relieve them of stress. This project can and will be measured by the suicide rate to see and determine whether it actually relieves them.  </p>
