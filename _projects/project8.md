<p>Our project is called Tech-Ops, a mobile app for children with special needs. The app would target students from grades 6 through 11 with learning disorders, specifically dislexia. We chose this age range because after some research, we came to find that dislexia worsens during middle school due to the increasingly rigorous curriculum. In addition, we would hold classes for students who attended Atlanta public schools and provide the neccessary technology and resources to help them succeed. The app would constantly be improved with updates that featured new lessons and interface changes. We would beta-test the app with groups of students who have dislexia, and ask for helpful learning tools from highschool and college alumni who suffered from dislexia.</p>
