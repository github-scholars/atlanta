<p>Our project is targetting a prominent issue contributing to the social divide, language aquisition. Our idea is to get people together and teach them the basics of a language by utilizing tech. Unlike other programs aimed toward language aquisition, our project would also teach sign-language by use of tablets and instructive, interactive lessons. Solving the social divide would allow people in different communities who wouldn't typically communicate with each other the oppurtunity to collaborate and improve the environment around them.</p>
