<p>Our social imapact program, The Connect, plans to contribute to the digital divide’s end by providing low income communities with recycled technology from homes, businesses, and schools that are equipped with the newest technologies, but who haven’t done away with their old equipment. This will give people who don't have access to developing technologies the ability to connect and be a part of the tech community.
